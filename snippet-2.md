# Code Snippet 2

```
1. let num = 20;
2. console.log(num + "20");
3. console.log(++num);
```

## Explanation:
1. `let num = 20;` -> Declares a variable num and assigns it the value 20.
2. `console.log(num + "20");` -> Concatenates the value of num which is 20 with the string "20", resulting in the string `"2020"`
3. `console.log(++num);` -> Increments the value of num by one (pre-increment), so num becomes 21, and then logs it to the console.

## Output:
```
"2020"
21
```
