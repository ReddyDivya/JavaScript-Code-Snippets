# Code Snippet - 8

```
let num = 25;
console.log(num++);//25
console.log(++num);//27
console.log(num);//27
console.log(num++);//27
console.log(num);//28
```

# Code Explanation:

- `let num = 25;` - Declares a variable num and initializes it with the value 25.
- `console.log(num++);` - Logs the current value of num (which is 25) to the console, and then increments num by 1 after returning the value.
- `console.log(++num);` - Increments num by 1 before logging its value (which is now 26) to the console.
- `console.log(num);` - Logs the current value of num (which is 27) to the console.
- `console.log(num++);` - Logs the current value of num (which is 27) to the console, and then increments num by 1 after returning the value.
- `console.log(num);` - Logs the current value of num (which is 28) to the console.
